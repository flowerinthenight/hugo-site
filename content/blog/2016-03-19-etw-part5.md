Check out the codes in [GitHub](https://github.com/idrilsilverfoot/win32-etw-manifest).

I generated a C# logging class using this command:

```sh
mc -css <Namespace_here> jytrace.man
```

So far, most of my event templates use an ANSI string data type which (I believe) is not supported by C#. As you can see in part 1, I use ANSI data type for my File and Function fields so that I can use `__FILE__` and `__FUNCTION__` as inputs in C++. Thats why I added a new event template with all fields using UNICODE data types. Again, you can refer to the whole package here for reference.

To use the logging class, I added the generated file to my project. I also added a wrapper class so I can use the `CallerMemberName` and `CallerFilePath` attributes in C#.

```csharp
public static bool Verbose(
    string m,
    [CallerMemberName] string memberName = "?",
    [CallerFilePath] string srcFile = "?",
    [CallerLineNumber] int srcNum = 0)
{
    return JyTrace.ProviderJyTrace.EventWriteSimple("ETWTest", Path.GetFileName(srcFile), memberName, "Trace:", m);
}
```

The actual log call:

```csharp
TraceCore.Verbose("Hello from CS!");
```
