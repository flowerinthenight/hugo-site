I uploaded an example code on how to monitor a Dynamodb table (INSERT, MODIFY, and REMOVE) using [dynamodbstreams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html), lambda, SNS, and SQS. Please have a look [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/dynamodbstreams-lambda-sns-sqs).
