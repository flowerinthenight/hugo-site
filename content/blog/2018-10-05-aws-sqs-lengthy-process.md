Before, I uploaded an example on how to handle lengthy processing of PubSub subscription messages in [GitHub](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/gcp-pubsub-lengthy-consume). This time, it's for AWS SQS. Have a look at the sample code [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/sqs-lengthy-consume).
