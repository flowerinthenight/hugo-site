I recently uploaded a tool to GitHub that downloads [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) query results as CSV. It's called [`athena2csv`](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/athena2csv). You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/athena2csv). You might find this useful.
