I have uploaded an example of how to handle lengthy processing of PubSub subscription messages in GitHub. If you are using PubSub and are, at times, struggling with PubSub default deadlines, you might find this example helpful. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/gcp-pubsub-lengthy-consume).
