I recently uploaded a tool to GitHub that wraps the `kubectl get events -w` command for watching `OOMKilled` events in Kubernetes. It's called [`oomkill-watch`](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/oomkill-watch). You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/oomkill-watch). You might find this useful.
