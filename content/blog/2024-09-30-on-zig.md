In continuation with my [previous post](/blog/2024-08-20-thoughts-on-newer-system-languages/) about the new systems programming languages, I mentioned I was considering [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) as a potential complementary systems language to our main one, which is Go(lang). Well, for the past month or so, in my spare time, I tried writing something more substantial in it to understand the language more. For some time now, I've been "itching" to write something similar to Hashicorp's [memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist) library, but in a lower-level language for performance, smaller footprint and minimal network load. Now, I've [used](/blog/2023-04-28-hedge-memberlist/) `memberlist` before, and it is a superb piece of code, but I wanted something that supports a consistent leader across the whole fleet. It's a requirement to a system I plan on building in the near future (more on this in a later post). My top choices were C, Rust, and Zig, and as I said, I took a liking to Zig due to its promised simplicity, so I wrote it in Zig. The project is called `zgroup`, and you can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/zgroup) if you're interested. It's still similar to `memberlist` but with the added capability of electing a leader across the whole group. It uses both the [SWIM Protocol](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf), which `memberlist` uses, and [Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)'s leader election algorithm.

Anyway, so what do I think of Zig? I think it has a lot of promise. It still feels incomplete, which it is, especially the standard library. Which is expected of course for a < v1.0 software. But coming from C, and Go, I think Zig is the sweet spot for me between C++ and Rust. But I don't think I will be introducing it to [Alphaus](https://www.alphaus.cloud/) anytime soon though; maybe when it's tagged v1.0+, which I think is still years from now.
