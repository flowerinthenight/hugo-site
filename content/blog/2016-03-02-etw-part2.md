# Compiling the manifest file

This is how I compiled my manifest file.

* Open Visual Studio command prompt.
* Compile manifest file.

```sh
mc -um <manifest_file>.man
```

When successful, output files are:

```sh
<filename>.h
<filename>.rc
<filename>TEMP.BIN
MSG00001.bin
```

# Creating the message resource DLL

I like to create a separate dll just for the manifest file resource although you can also add the .rc file to any of your existing dll or exe.

## Compile .rc to .res

```sh
rc <filename>.rc
```

## Create .dll from .res

```sh
link -dll -noentry -out:<out>.dll <filename>.res
```

# Register the manifest to the system (optional)

I always register the manifest file on my development systems. As for client systems, its up to you. I dont.

Open admin command prompt and execute

```sh
wevtutil im <manifest_file>.man /rf:"full_path_to_resource_dll" /mf:"full_path_to_resource_dll"
```

# Remove the manifest from the system

Open admin command prompt and execute

```sh
wevtutil um <manifest_file>.man
```
