A couple of days ago, I uploaded a generic service in GitHub that has a feature of updating itself. Check out the post [here](http://flowerinthenight.com/blog/2016/09/27/windows-delay-update-service-go). Today, I uploaded the actual service I'm using in our CI environment, excluding the configuration file.

Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/holly).
