I uploaded an ancient prototype driver code I used ages ago in testing the [DRV2605](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf) haptic device from Texas Instruments. I can't figure out (and I also don't have time either) how to make this thing build using the recent versions of Visual Studio. Nonetheless, I'm putting this out there as reference to somebody doing something similar to this project. Source code is [here](https://github.com/flowerinthenight/tidrv2605-haptic-driver-umdf).
