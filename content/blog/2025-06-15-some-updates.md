Apologies for being silent for a while. Still alive here; still doing CTO work for Alphaus. But at the same time, since about the start of the year, I started another startup here in Tokyo with two other cofounders. Long story short - it didn't really pan out, at least for me. I mean, the startup is still moving forward, but with me no longer in it. I "resigned", just recently actually, due to founder conflict. There was a lot going for it; it got accepted into the Antler Japan accelerator program (Batch 4) this year. It also received an infra backing from Google Cloud worth about $100K. Anyway, it is what it is, and I have to move on.

To some extent, I'm actually quite relieved that it didn't really work out for me as I was almost at the brink of burning out. I've spent most of my non-work time (late nights, weekends, holidays) for that startup that it affected my health and personal relationships (not surprising, really), which would have been disastrous.

Now, I'm working on another startup (again) in my spare time, and in my own pace. I'm still with Alphaus during normal work times but I've been building this new one slowly and steadily. It's still bootstrapped at the moment; I don't think it's a good idea, nor good timing, to entertain any form of outside investments at this point given its current state. My CEO knows about it, and he's very supportive.

I might talk about it at some point in the future but in the meantime, I'll continue building it in stealth mode.

Just so you know.
