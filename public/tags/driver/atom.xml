<p>A pretty good writeup that explains the internals of writing a camera filter driver in Windows can be found <a href="https://virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2018/09/through-looking-glass-webcam-interception-and-protection-kernel-mode/">here</a>. I&rsquo;m putting this information out as this repo is one of the references used in the writeup.</p>
<p>Original post:</p>
<p>This post is a bit of a departure from my usual golang/cloud-related ramblings. I posted an open-source <a href="https://github.com/flowerinthenight/windows-camera-class-filter-driver">camera class filter driver</a> for Windows ages ago hoping that it would help someone working on a similar project. If you are familiar with this type of driver, you probably know that it&rsquo;s not that straightforward to write mainly due to it being generally undocumented. A lot of reverse engineering has been done to write this driver. Anyway, recently, someone pointed out to me that it&rsquo;s been discussed in <a href="https://www.osronline.com/showthread.cfm?link=288736">this forum post</a>. So if you&rsquo;re working on a similar project, give it a whirl, and if you find some issues, I would appreciate it if you could submit a PR for fixes. Thanks.</p>

I can&rsquo;t figure out (and I also don&rsquo;t have time either) how to make this thing build using the recent versions of Visual Studio. Nonetheless, I&rsquo;m putting this out there as reference to somebody doing something similar to this project.
